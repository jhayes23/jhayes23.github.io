    <p id="about-me">
        I'm currently a junior CS major attending San Francisco State University after wrapping up my lower
        undergraduate
        studies at
        City College of San Francisco. I started my journey in the coding world by learning SQL
        to make my work-life simpler and fell in love. After that, the rest was pretty much history. My main hobbies
        include
        solving puzzles,
        taking care of a dozen plants, tinkering with new tools and concepts, and finding the next big thing.
