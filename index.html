                        <p>
                            I'm currently a junior CS major attending San Francisco State University after wrapping up my lower undergraduate studies at
                            City College of San Francisco. I started my journey in the coding world by learning SQL
                            to make my worklife simpler and fell in love. After that, the rest was pretty much history. My main hobbies include solving puzzles,
                            taking care of a dozen plants, tinkering with new tools and concepts, and finding the next big thing.
